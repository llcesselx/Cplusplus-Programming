#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// The ternary operator ?: is a powerful operator than can check a condition
	// and return an expression based on the returned value from the condition.
	// 
	// For example: 
	int age = 29, birthMonth = 4, birthDay = 8, toMonth = 7, toDay = 31;
	(birthMonth == toMonth) ? "It is your birth month!" : "It is not your birth month.";


	// Another example of how powerful this operator is assigning a third variable 
	// with the ternary operator. The expression below assigns the variable modulusNum
	// the number 999 if the remainder of the number five divided by number two is one. 
	// If it is not equal to one, then the variable, modulusNum, is assigned the number
	// zero. 
	// 
	// For example: 
	int numOne = 1, numTwo = 2, numFive = 5, numTen = 10, modulusNum;
	modulusNum = (numFive % numTwo == 1) ? 999 : 0;
	cout << modulusNum << endl;
	

	// The ternary operator can return a variable of different data types like numbers,
	// strings, boolean values, etc. 
	// 
	// For example: 
	int myAge, pineyAge = 1;
	string whosOlder;
	cout << "\nEnter your age: ";
	cin >> myAge;
	whosOlder = (myAge > pineyAge) ? "\nYou are older than Piney." : "\nPiney is older than you.";
	cout << whosOlder << endl;

	return 0;
}
